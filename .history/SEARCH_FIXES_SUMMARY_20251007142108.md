# Search Endpoint Fixes Summary

## Problem Identified
The frontend was making requests to an incorrect endpoint `/jewelry/search` which returned 404 errors, while the correct endpoint was `/products/search`. Additionally, there was a user ID handling issue in the product handler.

## Root Causes
1. **Incorrect Endpoint**: Frontend JavaScript was calling `/jewelry/search` instead of `/products/search`
2. **User ID Mismatch**: Product handler expected MongoDB ObjectId but received UUID strings from authentication

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Frontend Endpoint Corrections
**Files Modified:**
- `static/app.js` - Updated searchProducts and searchByImage methods
- `mystreamlit_app.py` - Updated product search calls

**Changes:**
- Changed all instances of `/jewelry/search` to `/products/search`
- Fixed both text search and image search functionality

### 2. Backend User ID Handling Fix
**Files Modified:**
- `product_handler.py` - Updated user lookup logic

**Changes:**
- Modified user lookup to handle both MongoDB ObjectIds and UUID strings
- Added fallback mechanism to find users by either `_id` or `user_id` fields
- Maintains compatibility with both old and new user accounts

### 3. Verification Tests
**Files Created:**
- `test_search_fix.py` - Comprehensive test suite

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Server status verification
- ✅ Old endpoint returns 404 (as expected)
- ✅ New endpoint works with authentication
- ✅ New endpoint blocks unauthorized requests
- ✅ Authentication flow works correctly
- ✅ Frontend UI protection is functional

## Results
- ✅ All search functionality now works correctly
- ✅ No more 404 errors for search requests
- ✅ Authentication properly protects search endpoints
- ✅ Both text and image search work as expected
- ✅ Frontend and backend are properly synchronized

## Testing
Run the verification test:
```bash
python test_search_fix.py
```

This will verify that:
1. The old `/jewelry/search` endpoint returns 404
2. The new `/products/search` endpoint works correctly
3. Authentication is properly enforced
4. Search results are returned successfully
